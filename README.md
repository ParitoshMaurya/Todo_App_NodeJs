# Todo App NodeJs
In this project, I have made a ToDo List App using NodeJS, express and MYSQL database connection. A user can add, delete, update, view and search all his tasks. I used pug view tempelate as it becomes quite easy to undestand the syntax and render the data from backend to pug. I have used Knex query builder and proper routes for each action.

## Requirements
If you're using Linux-based OS, install the latest version of Nodejs and npm, by typing the following commands on your terminal.
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential apt-transport-https lsb-release ca-certificates curl
```
Then, for the Latest release (version 13), add this PPA, by typing the following command on your terminal
```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_13.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install nodejs
```
Then type `npm install` to install all node modules. You can start server by typing `npm start`
